# Image and Video Colorizer using Deep Learning Algorithms

## Project Overview

This project automates the colorization of grayscale images and videos using deep convolutional neural networks. The application includes a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to select media files, process them, and save colorized outputs easily.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the model file (`colorization_release_v2.caffemodel`) from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iR7LoniQVZuIB3Yf2ceJpCBL2v6hoJsy?usp=sharing) and place it in the `model` directory.

## Usage Instructions

* Run the application using:

  ```bash
  python colorizer_app.py
  ```
* Use the GUI to select grayscale images/videos.
* Start the colorization process.
* Save the resulting colorized output.

## Notes

* The repository does not include the `colorization_release_v2.caffemodel` file due to size limits. Download it from the link above.
